Description: Set go minimum version to 1.22
 Starting in go 1.21, the "toolchain $VERSION" line in the go.mod file mandates
 that a version greater or equal the specified one is used. When the local go
 version does not meet that requirement, the go tooling tries to download a new
 version of the toolchain to meet that requirement.  As per the bug linked in
 the comment above the snippet pinning the toolchain to 1.22.4, we see that the
 specified point release is fixing a issue that only occours with go >= 1.22
 and < 1.22.4 and glibc 1.31. Since this is not the case in jammy (we have
 glibc 1.35), let's remove the constraint.
 See https://go.dev/doc/toolchain for further reference.
